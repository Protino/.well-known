    <p>WHO recently published their latest study which revealed that the
        <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/14-of-worlds-15-most-polluted-cities-in-india/articleshow/63993356.cms"
            target="_blank">14 most polluted cities in the world are in India. </a>It is clear that air
        pollution is not just a Delhi problem. It is also clear that the scale of the problem is huge
        and air pollution may well be the biggest health risk facing India. So here are some
        myth-busters to help you understand common myths surrounding air pollution and learn to
        separate them from facts.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">MYTH - Breathing polluted air will make you immune to it</p>
    <p><b>FACT - </b>Unfortunately no! Pollutants are toxic substances emitted as a result of fuel
        burning. These toxins severely impact our immune system, so our body loses its strength to
        fight infections. So, just as smoking cigarettes will not make you immune to lung cancer and
        consuming arsenic will not make you immune to poisoning, breathing in polluted air will only
        make your respiratory organs weaker. This in turn may lead to asthma, lung cancer, COPD and
        even heart attacks.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">MYTH - Indoor air is cleaner than outdoors</p>
    <p><b>FACT - </b><a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/inside-story-guide-indoor-air-quality" target="_blank">As
            per the EPA guidebook for indoor air quality, </a>indoor air is often as
        bad as, and sometimes worse than outdoor air. Multiple sources within homes and work spaces,
        that may not have a significant impact individually, cumulatively can pose a serious risk,
        especially considering that we all spend a majority of our time indoors – either at home or at
        work. </p>
    <p>Cooking, burning incense and candles, using perfumed sprays and deodorants and smoking indoors
        reduce indoor air quality. Work spaces may also have a higher degree of VOC’s from furniture
        and paints.</p>
    <p>Ventilation is also a significant contributor to indoor air quality. Excess ventilation can
        cause infiltration of outdoor air, bringing in particulate matter and dust. Outside air also
        leaks in through joints in doors and window panes. Less ventilation on the other hand can cause
        pollutants to accumulate to high levels that can pose health and comfort problems. If there are
        several individuals indoors like for example in an office or school, the levels of carbon
        di-oxide can also increase significantly leading to discomfort and reduced productivity.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">MYTH - Poor air quality is only a winter phenomenon</p>
    <p><b>FACT - </b>Air quality in many cities of India <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_polluted_cities_by_particulate_matter_concentration"
            target="_blank">(10 out of 20 of the most polluted cities globally are in India - WHO) </a>far
        exceeds the <a href="https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr_docs/FINAL-REPORT_AQI_.pdf" target="_blank">AQI
            standards prescribed by the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) </a>throughout the year.
        <a href="https://secured-static.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/Airpoclypse--Not-just-Delhi--Air-in-most-Indian-cities-hazardous--Greenpeace-report.pdf"
            target="_blank">A Greenpeace report that studied air quality in every Indian state </a>throughout
        the year, showed PM, ozone and nitrogen-oxide levels constantly higher than the annual average
        prescribed by CPCB throughout the year. Grey skies are only more visible in the winter months,
        owing to the phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology)" target="_blank">inversion.
        </a></p>
    <p class="subtitle">MYTH - There is nothing we can do</p>
    <p><b>FACT - </b>Fact is that each of us can make a difference. Changing our own behaviour such as
        keeping cars and bikes well-tuned, adopting greener fuels like petrol instead of diesel that
        have lower emissions, segregating and composting our waste, car-pooling and using public
        transport can help us reduce our own carbon footprint. By reporting waste burning and cars
        emitting black fumes to authorities, and driving awareness in our own communities we can make
        wider impact to help reduce air pollution in our neighbourhoods.</p>
    <p>In addition, simple actions on our part - like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.airveda&amp;hl=en"
            target="_blank">constantly monitoring air quality </a>to manage when we are exercising
        outdoors, or letting our children go out and play or wearing a <a href="http://www.airveda.com/mask-details"
            target="_blank">fitted mask </a>on very poor air quality days can help reduce our exposure
        outdoors. Controlling indoor air quality using plants, air purifiers and <a href="http://www.airveda.com/airveda-product-catalog"
            target="_blank">indoor air quality monitors </a>can significantly reduce our exposure
        indoors.</p>
    <p class="subtitle">MYTH - Only people with respiratory problems need to worry about air pollution</p>
    <p><b>FACT - </b>Air pollution is caused due to toxic substances. These when inhaled enter the
        blood stream and weaken the immune system, making us more susceptible to respiratory and
        coronary illnesses. So even people who are perfectly healthy can develop respiratory problems
        when exposed to air pollution for an extended period of time. WHO in its report also
        highlighted that air pollution is responsible for causing an estimated one-quarter (24%) of all
        adult deaths from heart disease, 25% from stroke, 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary
        disease and 29% from lung cancer.</p>
