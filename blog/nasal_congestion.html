            Vitamin C,
            like Indian Gooseberry (<b>Amla</b>), Orange, Guava, Broccoli etc.</li>

            Nasal
            congestion. Two relatively easy points one can try are - press the joint near the bridge of the nose and
            eye socket with the tips of your thumbs and the point on the edge of both the nostrils where you can feel
            your cheek bone, do this for at least 2-3 minutes. Repeat this process several times during the day. The
            pressure should be only as much you can tolerate.</li>

        In case of allergens in the environment, like smell of paint, pollen, congress grass or some chemicals Jal
        Neti,
        once a day, can help a lot. After doing Jal Neti, putting a drop of cow <b>ghee</b> (clarified butter) in
        nostrils
        will
        have a soothing affect. The <b>ghee</b> can be applied to infants too.
