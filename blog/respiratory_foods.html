    <p> Our respiratory system is the most crucial, yet most abused organ system in our body. Various external
        stressful factors such as polluted air, weather changes, unhealthy food intake, erratic schedules, improper
        lifestyle etc. play havoc on our immunity, and the respiratory organs bear the brunt. Yet most people tend to
        ignore respiratory well-being.</p>

    <p> A well-balanced diet plays a key role in protecting our body from respiratory infections. Including various
        nutrients in our meals on a regular basis can help strengthen our respiratory system, and keep infections at
        bay. Here are five such foods that we must include in our diet this season.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Protein</p>
    <p> Protein is essential for tissue growth and adequate intake helps repair any internal damage that infections may
        cause. Milk can be a good source; however milk can sometimes increase mucus formation and consumption is
        therefore
        specific to each individual, depending on whether or not their body accepts it.</p>
    <p>
        <i>Recommendation: Protein can be incorporated into everyday diet through pulses & lentil soup, boiled eggs,
            chicken soup or grilled fish.</i>
    </p>

    <p class="subtitle">Fruits & Vegetables</p>
    <p>
        Antioxidants present in fruits and vegetables play a vital role in protection as they help fight free radicals.
        They improve immunity and reduce the impact of external pollutants on our body's organs. Including a lot of
        colorful fruits and vegetables such as red & yellow bell peppers, tomatoes, beetroot, carrot, papaya, and
        pomegranates provides multiple vitamins and minerals and increases overall immunity. Vitamin C rich sources
        such as Kiwi, orange, sweet lime, green leafy vegetables, broccoli etc. are esepcially useful in strengthening
        the
        respiratory system. These are also rich in magnesium which helps in clearing the respiratory pathway. Onions
        are anti-inflammatory, and beneficial in treating respiratory infections.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            Recommendation: Fruits and vegetables can be added into our diet as soups, subzis, and salads or just as
            raw
            snacks.</i>
    </p>

    <p class="subtitle">Herbs & Spices</p>
    <p>
        Spices & herbs contain <a href="http://www.lcis.com.tw/paper_store./paper_store/antibacterial_acitvity_of_herbs_and_spices-20141210231453171.pdf">anti-bacterial
            and anti-inflammatory compounds</a> that boost immunity and fight infections.
        Roots such as ginger helps in detoxifying the lungs, while turmeric has anti-bacterial properties. Various
        fresh leaves like basil, mint, and coriander also can be used to detox and have a calming effect.

        <i>Recommendation: Herbs and spices can be infused and consumed as herbal concoctions or teas.</i>
    </p>

    <p class="subtitle">Nuts, seeds & oils</p>
    <p>
        Nuts and seeds are nutrient dense, rich in minerals & omega 3/6 fatty acids and contain Vitamin E which is very
        important to repair cells damaged due to infections. Intake of fish oil, flax seed powder and chia seeds are
        also beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            Recommendation: Include 5-6 nuts daily as snacks and munch on seeds such as watermelon seeds, pumpkin seeds
            or sunflower seeds to boost immunity.</i>
    </p>

    <p class="subtitle">Probiotics</p>
    <p>
        A healthy gut promotes overall health. Healthy bacteria in probiotics, such as curd and buttermilk, help in
        reducing inflammation and strengthening the immune system. As long as consumed fresh, and at room temperature
        and
        during the day time, curd is a healthy inclusion towards a strong respiratory system.
