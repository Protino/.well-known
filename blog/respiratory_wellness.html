        Ayurveda - one of the oldest bodies of knowledge on holistic wellness, has its roots ingrained in the
        philosophy
        that food plays a big part in our well-being. As per Ayurveda and Yoga humans have psycho-physiological
        constitution. The three doshasâ€”Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - that form the core principles of the Ayurvedic system,
        are
        derived from the five elements. Vata controls movement like breath, blood circulation, urination etc., Pitta
        controls metabolism and Kapha controls structure, holds cells together and forms muscles, fat, bones etc. All
        three
        doshas are found in varying proportions in every person.

        Respiratory problems are linked to Vata and Kapha. The food one consumes should be governed by the person's
        constitution, season, as well as time of the day.
