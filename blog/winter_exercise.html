    <p>There is no better start to a winter day than a run in the crisp morning air, followed by breakfast
        while basking in the warm winter sun. Increasingly, however, winters have become an omen of high
        pollution levels, severe air quality, choking smog and endless respiratory problems.</p>
    <p>We know that physical exercise is necessary for a healthy lifestyle and mental well-being. It has
        multiple health benefits - such as reducing the risk of diabetes, heart attack and stroke,
        strengthening the respiratory system, and also effectively countering stress and depression. People
        living in polluted areas face a higher risk of all the above ailments, making it imperative for them to
        exercise regularly. However, during any kind of physical exercise one inhales more frequently and more
        deeply, thus breathing in more air. Furthermore, one is more likely to breathe through the mouth,
        making the polluted air bypass the nasal passage, which normally filters out some airborne particles.

        While one may be inclined to avoid exercising in such conditions, studies have shown that it's better
        to workout regardless of external conditions, than to not exercise at all. A study conducted by
        researchers from the University of Copenhagen on 52,061 people over a period of 13 years, found that
        participants who took part in sports, cycling and gardening during the 13-year period showed a lesser
        likelihood of dying from any of the illnesses mentioned above, with benefits of outdoor physical
        activity not being reduced by exposure to pollution. The findings were reported in the journal of <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1408698/">Environmental
            Health Perspectives. </a></p>
    <p>Here are guidelines for exercising in heavily polluted areas.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Check the air quality in your area before exercising</p>
    <p>
        Apps, such as the free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.airveda">Airveda app</a>,
        provide air quality data in your area. Do an air quality check before you step out and try to limit
        outdoor exercises and runs to days when the air quality is not poor. If possible, go for runs during
        lunch or late afternoon, since air quality improves during the day as the day gets warmer. Furthermore,
        you don’t need to go running in order to get a great cardio workout. Light calisthenics, yoga, martial
        arts and indoor sports such as wall-climbing, tennis, badminton and squash, are all great alternatives
        for running. It’s better to choose exercises that do not require very heavy breathing or being outdoors
        where the pollution levels are high.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Airveda Suggests</i></strong></p>
    <p>Based on Indian AQI, we suggest the following exercise standards: </p>
    <img class="centerImg" src="http://www.airveda.com/resources/images/aqi_chart.jpg" />

    <p class="subtitle">Stick to greener areas for relatively cleaner air</p>
    <p>Trees and other vegetation release oxygen into the environment, making green areas such as parks more
        ideal for exercising outdoors. The greatest advantage is that there are less sources of vehicular
        emissions around, eliminating a whole range of pollutants. On days when it is safe to step outside (as
        per the chart above) choose green areas.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Keep a healthy distance from the road</p>
    <p>If you are cycling, jogging or walking outdoors, it is best to avoid doing so close to roads –
        particularly busy ones, or ones where there is construction going on – if possible. Studies have shown
        that air pollution levels are higher on busier roads due to vehicular emissions as well as dust that is
        kicked up by the vehicles, but that the amount of pollution drops in line with how far away you are
        from a road.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Move around vehicles</p>
    <p>When cycling, jogging or walking behind cars, scooters, motorcycles, lorries and other vehicles, you
        will breathe in very high levels of pollutants that can be harmful to your lungs. If it is safe to do
        so, move around these vehicles to try and reduce your exposure as well as keep your distance.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Avoid busy roads with high buildings</p>
    <p>Air pollution tends to get trapped on roads with tall buildings on either side, as the tall buildings
        block any breeze that may disperse the pollutants. Such roads usually have poor air quality and should
        be avoided for running, walks or cycling. Traffic lights are another pollution hotspot to avoid,
        because when vehicles move away from traffic lights they emit more pollutants.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Avoid exercising outdoors during rush hours</p>
    <p>Try to avoid exercising outdoors during rush hour, especially in busy traffic areas, or other times when
        there is heavy vehicular movement. Air quality is particularly bad at such times, and even though you
        may not be exercising close to the road, the air pollution will impact you. Choose an alternative,
        quieter time to workout.</p>


    <p class="subtitle">Wear a mask if possible</p>
    <p>You’ll breathe in harder, deeper and faster when exercising, meaning you’ll inhale a larger
        amount of pollutants than if you were just relaxing. For this reason, whether you are
        exercising outdoors or indoors, you should wear a pollution mask. They tend to get
        uncomfortable because you are breathing fast and releasing greater CO2. So finding <a href="http://www.airveda.com/mask-details">a
            mask which has really good CO2 ventilation </a>will be essential to be able to use a mask
        during heavy exercise.</p>

    <p>
        Food plays a major role in helping your body fight air pollution. Antioxidants help the body eliminate
        toxic substances. Foods that are rich in vitamins E &amp; C, such as fruits, as well as green, leafy
        vegetables which are high in antioxidants should feature in your diet daily. (Hear from wellness
        expert, Ms Saroj Modi, about what foods help you build a stronger respiratory system <a href="http://www.airveda.com/blog/foods-for-respiratory-wellness">here.</a>)</p>
