        Exercise is a must for a healthy and long life. For those with asthma however, exercise carries many
        challenges, many of which are fortified by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1214556/">myths
            such as “exercise causes asthma to worsen”</a>. Nothing can be
        further from the truth. While exercise may trigger shortness of breath in any person, for those suffering from
        asthma the symptoms are more pronounced and may include hyperventilation and chest discomfort. On the other
        hand, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8620700">exercising in controlled conditions improves the
            lungs, </a> boosts the immune system and keeps weight under check – all of which help reduce asthma
        symptoms. A review of 19 studies (involving 695 people) on exercises for asthma, published in the <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD001277/AIRWAYS_breathing-exercises-for-asthma">Cochrane
            Database of Systematic Reviews in 2012</a>, found that exercise for asthma is not only safe, but also
        improves
        heart and lung fitness, and improves quality of life.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some exercises that people ailing from asthma, of any age, can safely perform daily.</p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Walking</b> - <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7af5/fda029fface9f6201fc4bf1c86f16df68240.pdf">A
                    study by NCBI</a> that assessed the effects of a 12-week supervised exercise intervention
                followed by 12 weeks of self-administered exercise, on adults with partially controlled asthma, found
                that
                adults who walked three times a week for 12 weeks actually displayed improved asthma control and
                fitness
                levels without provoking an attack, indicating that a structured exercise intervention can improve
                asthma
                control.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Yoga</b> - Yoga is great for people with asthma. Yoga centers around breathing control, thereby
                improving blood
                circulation in the respiratory organs and making them stronger. A 2012 study published in the Journal
                of
                Alternative and Complementary Medicine found that yoga training over 10 weeks significantly improved
                quality of
                life scores for women with mild to moderate asthma. Additionally, people who practice Hatha yoga for
                two-and-a-half hours a week for these 10 weeks were able to cut down on their asthma medication. Tai
                Chi, a
                martial art that also lays stress on breathing, was shown to have produced similar effects.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Swimming</b> - This is the ideal sport for those with asthma. The natural pressure that water
                applies on
                the
                sinuses helps unblock them. Also the natural action of swimming exercises the muscles that support the
                respiratory organs, making them stronger. The air that one breathes while swimming is also highly
                humidified
                and warm, helping control symptoms of an asthma attack. Do ensure that the chlorine level in the water
                is
                not
                excessive, as chemicals may trigger an attack. Additionally, avoid swimming in open sea as the salt
                water
                mist
                may cause breathing trouble.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Biking</b> - Biking should be practiced with care, as rapid biking requires rapid breathing, which
                may
                trigger
                an
                asthma attack. Mountain biking should be avoided as well, as uphill biking may dry out airways due to
                rapid
                breathing. If you love the wheels then head out on a flat surface at a pace that is comfortable to you.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Running</b> - Short distance running at a uniform pace with frequent rests, done in clear air
                provides
                adequate
                exercise to the lungs without taxing it too much. For those who wish to run a marathon, regular
                practice to
                build up lung capacity is crucial.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Dance</b> - Dance creates a balance between breathing and workout, also allowing for intermittent
                breaks. As
                with
                swimming, it helps with building muscle strength in the muscles that support the respiratory organs.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Golfing</b> - A round of golf does wonders for the peace of mind; in addition it is an excellent
                exercise for
                those
                with severe asthmatic conditions. The alternate rounds of swinging and walking sets a relaxed pace. It
                would be
                prudent to check the air quality outdoors before deciding on a day of golfing, as well as taking
                adequate
                protection, such as masks, against pollen.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Racquet sports</b> - Tennis and indoor racquet sports like badminton allow short spurts of workout
                with
                regular
                rests in between. This makes it ideal for people prone to asthma attacks. Do remember to check outdoor
                air
                quality levels before stepping out for outdoor racquet sports like tennis.</li>

                How to Stay Active During Winters In Spite of Pollution</a></p>

        <p> Some tips to keep in mind when you go exercising:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Start small, with short exercise durations, and work your way upwards, to reduce the possibility of
                exercise-induced asthma.</li>
            <li>Always carry reliever medication and spacer with you.</li>
            <li>Warm up before any kind of exercise.</li>
            <li>While exercising, watch for asthma symptoms. Stop and take your reliever medication if symptoms appear.
                Refrain from returning to exercise immediately.</li>
            <li>After exercise, do stretches to cool down as asthma symptoms can even occur up to half an hour after
                exercise.</li>
        </ul>
