    <p class="title">What is CO?</p>
    <p>Carbon monoxide(CO) is an odorless, colorless and toxic gas. Because it is impossible to see,
        taste or smell the
        toxic fumes, CO can kill you before you are aware it is in your home.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">What are the sources of CO and precautions to protect against them?</p>
    <p>CO is produced by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as wood, petrol, coal,
        natural gas and kerosene. Some of the common sources and precautions to protect against them are
        below: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Gas stoves - Install and use an exhaust fan that’s vented to the outdoors over gas stoves
            and regularly clean the oven cavity, burners, and range top to reduce the possibility of CO
            emissions.
        </li>
        <li> Generators and other gasoline-powered equipment - When purchasing gas-powered equipment,
            look for the seal of a national testing agency. This will ensure the equipment has been
            tested, inspected, and verified to meet strict requirements and is certified to be safe.
        </li>
        <li> back-drafting from furnaces, gas water heaters, wood stoves and fireplaces</li>
        <li> Automobile exhaust from attached garages, nearby roads or parking areas - To ensure your
            car isn’t leaking carbon monoxide, have a mechanic check the exhaust system once a year.
            What’s more, never run your car inside an attached garage, even with the garage door open.
        </li>
        <li> Back-drafting from furnaces, gas water heaters, wood stoves and fireplaces -Ensure
            appliances are vented properly.
        </li>
        <li> Gas space heaters - It’s important all gas appliances are properly vented. What’s more,
            ensure all space heaters are less than 20 feet from a window, vent or door.
        </li>
        <li> Furnaces and chimneys- Carbon monoxide can build up inside a home if debris is blocking a
            chimney. To prevent this, have your chimney and furnaces checked and cleaned every year.
        </li>
        <li>Smoking indoors - Never smoke indoors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additional ventilation can be used as a temporary measure when high levels of CO are expected for
        short periods of time. If CO levels are very high, then the best solution is to immediately move
        outside to fresh air.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">How is CO related to health?</p>
    <p>Hemoglobin is the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues all
        over the body, and it brings carbon dioxide (CO2) back from the tissues. CO unfortunately binds
        to hemoglobin over 200 times more easily than oxygen does, so if CO is present, oxygen will not
        be able to find space to get into the hemoglobin. As a result, parts of the body will be starved
        of oxygen, and the affected parts will die.</p>

    <p class="subtitle"> What are the Symptoms of CO poisoning?</p>
    <p>The person may feel as if they have the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/15107.php">flu</a>,
        but without a
        temperature. If several
        people in the same building have the same symptoms, they may have CO poisoning. The longer an
        individual is exposed to CO, the more severe the symptoms will become.</p>

    <p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">At low concentrations:</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fatigue in healthy people</li>
        <li>Chest pain in people with heart disease</li>
    </ul>

    <span style="font-weight:bold">At moderate concentrations:</span>

    <ul>
        <li>Angina</li>
        <li>Impaired vision</li>
        <li>Reduced brain function</li>
    </ul>

    <span style="font-weight:bold">At higher concentrations:</span>

    <ul>
        <li>Impaired vision and coordination</li>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Dizziness</li>
        <li>Confusion</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Flu-like symptoms that clear up after leaving home</li>
        <li>Fatal at very high concentrations</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subtitle">How can we reduce CO??</p>
    <p>
        It is most important to be sure combustion equipment is maintained and properly adjusted.
        Vehicular use should
        be carefully managed adjacent to buildings and in vocational programs. Additional ventilation
        can be used as a
        temporary measure when high levels of CO are expected for short periods of time.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Keep gas appliances properly adjusted.</li>
        <li> Consider purchasing a vented space heater when replacing an unvented one.</li>
        <li> Use proper fuel in kerosene space heaters.</li>
        <li> Install and use an exhaust fan vented to outdoors over gas stoves.</li>
        <li> Open flues when fireplaces are in use.</li>
        <li> Choose properly sized wood stoves that are certified to meet EPA emission standards. Make
            certain that
            doors
            on all wood stoves fit tightly.
        </li>
        <li> Have a trained professional inspect, clean and tune-up central heating system (furnaces,
            flues and
            chimneys)
            annually.
        </li>
        <li> Repair any leaks promptly.</li>
        <li> Do not idle the car inside garage.</li>
    </ul>
