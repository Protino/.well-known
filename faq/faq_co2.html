    <p class="title">What is CO2?</p>
    <p>CO2 is a natural constituent of the air we breathe; it is a colourless, odourless and non-flammable gas produced
        by metabolic processes (such as human breathing) and by combustion of fossil fuels.<br><br>The average outdoor
        air
        concentration of CO2 is in the order of 400 ppm. Indoor levels are usually higher, due to the CO2 exhaled by
        building occupants. Human respiration, indoor combustion appliances, in particular gas stoves, can also
        increase CO2 levels.<br><br><b>Health Impact of CO2</b><br><br>A study from the Harvard School of Public Health
        finds
        that carbon dioxide (CO2) has a direct and negative impact on human cognition and decision-making. They found
        that, on average, a typical participantâ€™s cognitive scores dropped 21 percent with a 400 ppm increase in
        CO2.<br><br>High levels of CO2 also indicate poor ventilation which can also lead to increased humidity, as
        moisture produced indoors is not vented to the outside. High humidity can encourage the growth of mould and
        dust mites; both of which are allergens and asthma triggers.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">How is the CO2 concentration related to your health?</p>
